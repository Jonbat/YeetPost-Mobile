# YeetPost-Mobile
YeetPost is a mobile cross-platform, messaging application, developed with Flutter. Users create location-based posts, called yeets, with the option to be anonymous. Unlike most social media and messaging applications, Yeetpost will contain a cyberbullying detection algorithm that will remove offensive yeets and replies using machine learning.
